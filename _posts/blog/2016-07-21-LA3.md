## Matrix Multiplication

There are 5 common multiply mmethods

### 1 just the define
    `A = matrix([
                      [      ],
                      [      ]
                      [a31 a32 a33]])`
    `B = matrix([
                      [ , b12, ],
                      [ , b22, ],
                      [ , b32, ]])
                      `
    `C = A * B = matrix([
                            [          ],
                            [          ],
                            [ , c32, ]])
                            `

that is, c<sub>32</sub> = a31*b12 + a32*b22 + a33*b32 = ∑a{3k}b{k2}; The entry in row i and column j of AB is **(row i of A) · (column j of B)**.


### 2 column vector

    `A = matrix([
                    [1,1],
                    [2,-1]
                    ])
    B = matrix([
                    [2, 2]
                    [3, 4]
                    ])
    C*1 = 2 * [1, 2].T + 3 [1,-1].T
    C*2 = 2 * [1, 2].T + 4 [1, -1].T
    `

A is column vector, and B is coefficient matrix(x, y).

### 3 row vector

    `A = matrix([
                    [1,1],
                    [2,-1]
                    ])
    B = matrix([
                    [2, 2]
                    [3, 4]
                    ])
    R1* = 1 * [2, 2] + 1 [3,4]
    R2* = 2 * [2, 2] + (-1)[3,4]
    `

Just like method 2, B is row vector, and A is coefficient matrix(x, y).

### 4 the define apply


    `A = matrix([
                    [1,1],
                    [2,-1]
                    ])
    B = matrix([
                    [2, 2]
                    [3, 4]
                    ])
    C1 = [1, 2].T * [2, 2] = [[2, 2], [4, 4]]
    C2 = [1, -1].T * [3,4] = [[3, 4], [-3, -4]]
    C = C1 + C2 = [[5,6],[1,0]]
    `

As you can see, C = C1*R1 + C2*R2.

## The Laws for Matrix Operations

Here are three addition laws:

    > A+B=B+A (commutative law)

    > c(A + B) = cA + cB (distributive law)

    > A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C ( associative law).
***
Three more laws hold for multiplication, but AB = BA is not one of them

    > AB ^= BA (the commutative "law" is usually broken

    > C(A + B) = CA + CB (distributive law from the left

    > (A + B)C = AC + BC (distributive law from the right)

    > A(BC) = (AB)C (associative law for ABC) (parentheses not needed).


## Inverse

(AB)<sup>-1</sup> = B<sup>-1</sup>A<sup>-1</sup>

There's no inverse if some combination of the columns gives nothing.

Ax=0

||A|| = 0

### Calculating A-I by Gauss-Jordan Elimination

pivot

E<sup>-1</sup><sub>21</sub>E<sup>-1</sup><sub>31</sub>E<sup>-1</sup><sub>32</sub> = L

LU

>>fuck sup sub is out of order!!!
