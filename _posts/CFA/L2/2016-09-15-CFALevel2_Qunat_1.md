## R9: Learning Outcomes


* The candidate should be able to:
* a.calculate and interpret a sample covariance and a sample correlation coefficient and interpret a scatter plot;
* b.describe limitations to correlation analysis;
* c.formulate a test of the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient equals zero and determine whether the hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance;
* d.distinguish between the dependent and independent variables in a linear regression;
* e.describe the assumptions underlying linear regression and interpret regression coefficients;
* f.calculate and interpret the standard error of estimate, the coefficient of determination, and a confidence interval for a regression coefficient;
* g.formulate a null and alternative hypothesis about a population value of a regression coefficient and determine the appropriate test statistic and whether the null hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance;
* h.calculate the predicted value for the dependent variable, given an estimated regression model and a value for the independent variable;
* i.calculate and interpret a confidence interval for the predicted value of the dependent variable;
* j.describe the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) in regression analysis, interpret ANOVA results, and calculate and interpret the F-statistic;
* k.describe limitations of regression analysis.

$$
Q=[\frac{\sum_{in}+k_{i,in}}{2m}-(\frac{\sum_{tot}+k_{i}}{2m})^2]-[\frac{\sum_{in}}{2m}-(\frac{\sum_{tot}}{2m})^2-(\frac{k_{i}}{2m})^2]
